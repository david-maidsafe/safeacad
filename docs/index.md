# SAFE Fleming Bible
This is a document that allows anyone in marketing to speak intelligently about Fleming, what it is and what it delivers at a technical level.

This will be an iterative document, where we will add and amend as we learn and
understand more about the Network.  

To ensure this is kept up-to-date, a version control log has been added so we can track on changes.
